## Eloquent Ai
This is a small package in very early development meaning that this readme is very basic and that it's functionality is limited.

### What is this package intended for?
The package intends to create a wrapper for different AI apis so that they can be declared as a provider and with the same syntax (in a style similar to other laravel packages) use another AI. Configuration information will appear soon and this readme will be updated.
